After every submission, I briefly explain what changes needed to be made and
what I did to iterate my work:

First Submission:
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

REQUIRED:
The rubric states "When player guesses correctly, new prompt shows with correct answer in the blank and....". 
Your program doesn't meet this requirement as it doesn't print the paragraph replaced with correct answer everytime 
after the user enters a correct one. Please create a copy of paragraph and each time when replacing the blank with correct answer, 
print it in this if scope.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Defined a new function "copy_paragraph()" that prints the whole paragraph with the correct, replaced answer.

REQUIRED:
lines, comments, or function definitions)" but the function is exceeding the number of lines limit. Following are few suggestions:

CHANGES MADE:
1. Defined a new function "ask_for_trys" as a little helper function to reduce code size.
2. removed empty print statements.
3. initialized index / counter_paragraph in 1 line.
4. "Outsorced" the whole ask-for-answer-part into a new function "ask_for_answer()".
5. Reduced size of biggest function from 52 to 27 (without lines, comments, or function definitions). I know, its still
more than required 18 lines but i completly lose the overview of the project if i use more helper-functions.

REQUIRED:
Rubric states "Each function includes a comment which explains the intended behavior, inputs (arguments), and outputs 
(return values) (if applicable)" but this documentation doesn't tell anything about input (parameters) and output (return values). 
You can write good documentation by following 'Docstring Conventions' in Python. Not only it helps other developers to understand 
its use and functionality but is also used to create documentation websites using tools like Sphinx. 
It is essential when you work in a team and helpful in future to write large applications. 
I will suggest you read about 'Docstring Conventions' like PEP 257 to write better documentation.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Read "PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions"
2. Inserted a docstring-documentation in all functions explaining what they do / what input values are / what value it returns.
