## Project 3 Create a movie website

Explored more advanced Python-Concepts & combined it with HTML/CSS to create a movie website.

- Reuse and share code with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Using function from the Python Standard Library
- Learning new concepts like classes, instances and inheritance

## Project 4.1 Decide your Path: Backend-Development

In the final project, the course introduced the tasks of different programming roles like:

- Frontend-Development
- Backend-Development
- Mobile (Android & iOS)
- Data Analyst

I had to decide which path to take and which final project to work on.
I choosed the Backend-Development-Path. Even though my skills & interests are way more into the Data Analyst-Specialization,
I already [did the project](https://github.com/Thalrion/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/project1) 2 months ago
when I started the Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

Even though I am absolutly curious about the Mobile-Path, the Backend-Path allows me to complement my Data-Analyst skills
because I am still lagging neccessary SQL-practise.

## Project 4.2 Build a SQL reporting tool to summarize data from a large database
